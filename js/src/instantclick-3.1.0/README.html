<h2 id="Contributing"><a href="#Contributing" class="headerlink" title="Contributing"></a>Contributing</h2><h3 id="Pull-Requests"><a href="#Pull-Requests" class="headerlink" title="Pull Requests"></a>Pull Requests</h3><p>If you have a feature in mind that you think would be a great fit for InstantClick, I recommend first to open an issue to debate whether it’s worthy of inclusion in the first place. Assume no feature/optimization is wanted. This way you won’t risk doing  work for nothing, and I won’t feel bad for throwing away your work.</p>
<p>Look around the code to spot code convention (two spaces for tabs, no semicolons at the end of lines, etc.). I’ll need those to be respected to accept a pull request.</p>
<p>In the (hopefully near) future I’ll open <a href="https://github.com/dieulot/instantclick/issues?state=open">issues</a> to say where I think InstantClick needs work on.</p>
<h3 id="Tests"><a href="#Tests" class="headerlink" title="Tests"></a>Tests</h3><p>Tests (in the <code>tests</code> folder) are HTML pages with which to check how InstantClick behaves on different browsers. That’s what I use before releasing a new version to make sure there is no obvious regressions.</p>
<p>Here are the tests that I do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on “Index page”, see if it works correctly.</li>
<li>Click on “Index page” with 2000 ms of delay, see if it works correctly.</li>
<li>Click on “Page with anchors #1”, click on “Page 2, anchor 1”, click on “Page 1, anchor 2”, go back and forward randomly. (At the time of this writing, 2014/03/19, scrolling <em>is</em> broken.)</li>
<li>In Internet Explorer 6, check that InstantClick’s “change” event is called, as it needs to fire even if InstantClick is unsupported.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start the tests website, with PHP 5.4 run <code>php -S 127.0.0.1:8000</code>, and head to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/tests/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/tests/</a>. (Be sure to start php in <code>tests</code>’s parent directory, not in <code>tests</code> itself.)</p>
<p>Or just put the <code>instantclick</code> folder in your <code>www</code> directory, and head to <a href="http://127.0.0.1/instantclick/tests/">http://127.0.0.1/instantclick/tests/</a>.</p>
<p>These tests are oriented towards InstantClick’s behaviors in browser. For most bug fixes, you won’t need to go through them.</p>
<p>If you need or want to go through them, be warned, they’re kind of a mess right now.</p>
